				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>The purpose of this project is to recreate the following image that is responsive to time and the user.</p>
				<img src = "https://cdn.glitch.global/e703a57e-f7f7-4451-b30a-d2b6102cb9b7/Monitor-Pass-38.webp?v=1713309407346" width="100" height="100">

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>This project was created with p5js. The continous mountains are created using noise. The trees are created using multiple triangles.<br>
					Everything else is made up of rectangles. Movement is achieved with every update to draw(), mainly with the use of millis().<br>
					The sun sets it's position to the mouse position. Random() is used for parts such as the position of the trees.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I am the only one who worked on this project. It was interesting to slowly build up the scene layer by layer. <br>
					The most difficult part was getting the movement to loop correctly. I think this experiment was a success, <br>
					especially the mountain and the parallax effect.
