				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>Using noise to create round natural looking biomes. The player can move a character with WASD or the arrow keys.
					There are three different biomes, grass, dirt, and stone. Trees can only grow on the grass biome.
					<br>
					Codes: 'g' == grass, 'd' == dirt, 's' == stone, 't' == tree
					<br>
					Life: There is a bird that moves in a random direction. The player character has an idle animation.
					<br>using tiles from

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>An array keeps track of the location of tiles. A script then takes that array and fills in a grid with corresponding tiles from a tilesheet.
					The array is generated using perlin noise, and the biome is determined by the value of the noise at specific coordinates.
					Tiles check their neighbors to determine how to make transitions.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I worked on this project alone. The difficult part of this was figuring out how to map tiles to the grid and figuring out how to make them transition.
					Having the player character being able to move around in the map is a success in my opinion.
