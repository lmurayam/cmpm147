				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>Generate rectangular rooms and connect them together. Uses autotiling logic for the walls.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>An array keeps track of the location of tiles. A script then takes that array and fills in a grid with corresponding tiles from a tilesheet.
					The array is created by generating rectangles and making sure they don't overlap. The corridors are created by taking the X midpoint of one room and the Y midpoint of another and then drawing a line to the new point from both rooms.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I worked on this project alone. The difficult part of this was making sure the rooms didn't overlap and creating the corridors.
					I think the autotiling turned out good, though it doesn't appear on the corridors because that would make them too narrow.
